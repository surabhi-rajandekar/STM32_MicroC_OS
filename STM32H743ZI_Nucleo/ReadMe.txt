This project is a basic project to blink an LED on STM32H743ZI2 using MicroC OS III. It uses BLINKY example code provided by MicroC OS with some adjustments related to toolchain and CMake build environment. 

Along with blinking an LED, I have added some code to test the Semaphores and Mutex in MicroC OS III.

IDE: VS Code Windows
Build environment: CMake with ARM GCC toolchain v11.2
